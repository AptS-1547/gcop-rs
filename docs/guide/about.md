# About gcop-rs

## Project History

gcop-rs is a Rust rewrite of the original [gcop](https://github.com/Undertone0809/gcop) project, which was created by [Undertone0809](https://github.com/Undertone0809) in Python.

The original gcop pioneered the concept of using AI to generate meaningful Git commit messages, making it easier for developers to maintain consistent and descriptive commit history. It proved the value of AI-assisted Git workflows and inspired many developers.

This Rust version builds upon that foundation, aiming to provide:
- Better performance through Rust's efficiency
- Lower resource usage
- Improved reliability and maintainability
- Extended features while preserving the core philosophy
