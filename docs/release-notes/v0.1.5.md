# Release v0.1.5

## 🔧 Simplified Config Edit Flow

The `config edit` command has been refactored for a cleaner, safer editing experience.

### What Changed

**Before (v0.1.4):**
1. Create backup file (`config.toml.bak`)
2. Open editor directly on config file
3. Validate after save
4. If failed: restore from backup

**After (v0.1.5):**
1. Read config into memory
2. Edit in temporary file (via `edit` crate)
3. Validate in memory
4. Only write to config file if validation passes

### Benefits

- **Safer**: Original file is never modified until validation passes
- **Consistent**: Uses same `edit` crate as commit message editing
- **Better UX**: Re-edit preserves your changes (no more losing edits on validation failure)
- **Cleaner**: No backup files left behind

### Menu Change

The validation failure menu now shows:

```
? What would you like to do?
> ✎ Re-edit the config file
  ↩ Keep original config        ← was "Restore previous config"
  ⚠ Ignore errors and save anyway (dangerous)
```

"Keep original" better reflects reality: the original file was never changed.
