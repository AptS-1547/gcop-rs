# Release v0.12.2

## Security Fix - Replace Unsound YAML Dependency

Replaced `serde_yml` (RUSTSEC-2025-0067, RUSTSEC-2025-0068) with `serde_yaml_ng`, a maintained fork of dtolnay's original `serde_yaml`. The previous `serde_yml` crate and its `libyml` dependency were flagged as unsound and unmaintained by RustSec.

### Changed

**Dependencies**

- Replaced `serde_yml` 0.0.12 with `serde_yaml_ng` 0.10.0 for YAML parsing
- `serde_yaml_ng` is a direct continuation of dtolnay's `serde_yaml`, based on `unsafe-libyaml` instead of the unsound `libyml`
- Resolves RUSTSEC-2025-0067 (libyml unsound) and RUSTSEC-2025-0068 (serde_yml unsound/unmaintained)
- `cargo audit` now passes with zero warnings

### Upgrade

```bash
# Homebrew
brew upgrade gcop-rs

# Cargo
cargo install gcop-rs

# pip
pip install --upgrade gcop-rs
```
