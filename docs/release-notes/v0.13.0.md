# Release v0.13.0

## Atomic Split Commit - Intelligent Multi-File Change Grouping

New `--split` mode automatically groups staged changes into multiple logical atomic commits using LLM analysis. Also includes LLM Provider interface refactoring and error handling improvements.

### Added

**Atomic Split Commit Mode**

- New `gcop-rs commit --split` groups staged files into logical atomic commits via LLM
- Interactive menu: Accept All / Edit in TOML editor / Regenerate / Regenerate with feedback / Quit
- Partial failure recovery: completed commits are preserved, remaining files re-staged
- Configurable via `[commit] split = true` in config or `--split` CLI flag

**Split-specific Error Types**

- `SplitCommitPartial`: reports completed/total groups on partial failure with recovery guidance
- `SplitParseFailed`: handles invalid LLM JSON responses with retry suggestions

**Internationalization**

- 21 new i18n strings for split commit UI, errors, and suggestions (en + zh-CN)

### Changed

**LLM Provider Interface Refactored**

- New `send_prompt(system, user, progress)` as the core trait method
- Provider implementations only need `send_prompt`; high-level APIs (`generate_commit_message`, etc.) have default implementations
- Enables callers to control prompt construction, required for split commit's custom prompt format

**CLI Parameter Restructuring**

- `CommitArgs` and `CommitOptions` restructured with `from_cli()` constructor
- All command option structs unified in style

**Dependencies**

- `clap` upgraded to 4.5.59
- `toml` upgraded to 1.0
- `reqwest` now uses `system-proxy` feature for automatic system proxy support
- MSRV lowered to 1.88.0

**Code Quality**

- All code comments unified to English
- README fully rewritten for both EN and ZH
