# Release v0.13.2

## Bug Fix - Claude Extended Thinking Support + Crash Report

Fixes Claude provider crash when the API response includes `thinking` blocks (from extended thinking / deep reasoning models). Also adds user-friendly crash reporting via `human-panic`.

### Fixed

**Claude Extended Thinking Response Parsing**

- Claude API responses with extended thinking include `thinking` type content blocks (no `text` field), causing `missing field 'text'` deserialization error
- Replaced flat `ContentBlock` struct with tagged enum using `#[serde(tag = "type")]` + `#[serde(other)]` fallback, consistent with the streaming SSE parser's approach
- Non-text blocks (thinking, tool_use, etc.) are now silently ignored
- 7 new tests: 4 unit tests for ContentBlock deserialization + 3 integration tests (with/without thinking, multiple text blocks)

### Added

**Crash Reporting**

- Integrated `human-panic` for user-friendly crash reports in release builds
- On panic, generates a report file with system info and prompts users to submit an issue
- Debug builds retain standard panic output for development

### Upgrade

```bash
# Homebrew
brew upgrade gcop-rs

# Cargo
cargo install gcop-rs

# pip
pip install --upgrade gcop-rs
