# Release v0.1.2

## 🔐 GPG Signing Support

gcop-rs now fully supports GPG commit signing. If you have `commit.gpgsign = true` or `user.signingkey` configured in your git config, commits will be automatically signed.

## 🔄 Improved Commit Workflow

### Feedback Accumulation

When using "Retry with feedback", your feedback now accumulates across retries instead of being replaced. This allows you to progressively refine the commit message:

```
1st retry: "use Chinese"
2nd retry: "be more concise"
→ AI sees both: "1. use Chinese  2. be more concise"
```

### Edit Returns to Menu

After editing a commit message, you now return to the action menu instead of immediately committing. This gives you the option to:
- Accept the edited message
- Edit again
- Regenerate with AI
- Cancel

## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

This release includes significant internal refactoring:

- **State Machine Pattern**: Replaced boolean flags with explicit `CommitState` enum for clearer control flow
- **Provider Abstraction**: Extracted common LLM provider code into shared utilities, reducing ~150 lines of duplication
- **Constants Centralization**: All magic numbers and default values now live in `src/constants.rs`
