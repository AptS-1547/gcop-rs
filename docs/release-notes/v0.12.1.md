# Release v0.12.1

## Editor Fallback - Robust Editor Selection with Automatic Recovery

Replaces `dialoguer::Editor` with the `edit` crate for editor handling. When `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR` points to an uninstalled program (e.g., `code --wait` after removing VS Code), the editor now automatically falls back through a platform-specific list of known editors instead of crashing with "IO error: program not found".

### Changed

**Editor Selection Overhaul**

- Replaced `dialoguer::Editor` with `edit` crate for all editor operations (`config edit` and commit message editing)
- Editor fallback chain: `$VISUAL` → `$EDITOR` → platform defaults (macOS: nano/vim/vi/emacs/open; Linux: sensible-editor/nano/vim/vi; Windows: notepad)
- Each candidate is verified via `which` before attempting to launch
- Removed `editor` feature from `dialoguer` dependency (still used for `Select` prompts)

**Release Workflow**

- Release now creates a draft first, publishes only after all jobs succeed
