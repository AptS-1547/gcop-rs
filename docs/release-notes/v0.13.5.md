# v0.13.5

Release date: 2025-02-21

## Highlights

This release improves **LLM response parsing robustness**, making `extract_text` fail explicitly with diagnostic information instead of silently returning null.

## Bug Fixes

### Response Path Traversal
- **Fix silent failure in `extract_text` when content path doesn't match response structure** — Previously, direct indexing with `current[key]` would silently return `Value::Null` when a key was missing. Now uses explicit `.get()` lookups with clear error messages indicating exactly where path traversal failed.
- **Add array index support in content paths** — Numeric keys in the content path are now automatically tried as array indices, supporting API responses that return array structures.
- **Enhanced error diagnostics** — On path traversal failure, `tracing::warn!` logs the remaining path and current value type, making it easier to debug provider response format issues.

## Upgrade Notes

- No configuration changes required
- No breaking changes
- Recommended if you've encountered "No text content in response" errors without clear cause
